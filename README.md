# onlineshopping

A new Flutter learning project. This app has support for web too. The demo is available [here](https://melvinodsa.github.io/onlineshopping-flutter/index.html#/). Got the inspiration from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBKzpTz65Io). The original tuorial doesn't support web. I made my own changes for images and using icons rather than loading SVG since flutter web support hasn't reached there yet.
